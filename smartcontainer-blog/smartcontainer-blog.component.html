        <h2>Convenient Locking and Unlocking Mechanisms</h2>
        <p>One of the standout features of Safeobuddy’s Smart Lock is its ability to function without a 
            network. This means you can lock and unlock the container even in areas with poor or no network 
            coverage, ensuring uninterrupted operations. The lock can be conveniently unlocked using a mobile 
            phone, adding a layer of flexibility and ease. Additionally, it offers remote unlocking through a web 
            dashboard, allowing authorized personnel to manage container access from anywhere in the world.

                <p> <strong>Enhanced Security with Invisible and Keyless Design</strong> The Smart Lock’s design is both innovative and practical. It is invisible from the outside, reducing 
                    the risk of tampering or break-ins. The keyless lock mechanism eliminates the need for physical 
                    keys, which can be lost or duplicated, enhancing security further. Safeobuddy’s Smart Lock also 
                    includes unauthorized lock open alerts, notifying you instantly if someone tries to tamper with the 
                    container, thereby providing an extra layer of security.

            <li>
                <p><strong>Battery Backup and Authorized Driver Access:</strong> To ensure continuous operation, the Smart Lock comes with an inbuilt battery backup. This feature 
                    guarantees that the lock remains functional even during power outages or in remote areas without 
                    reliable power sources. Moreover, the lock allows for authorized driver access, meaning only 
                    designated personnel can open the container, further safeguarding your shipment from unauthorized 
                    access.

            <li>
                <p> <strong>Real-Time Status Updates:</strong>Safeobuddy’s Smart Lock offers real-time status updates of the lock’s open and close activities. This 
                    feature is crucial for maintaining an accurate record of who accessed the container and when. It 
                    provides valuable data for audit trails, ensuring accountability and transparency in your logistics 
                    operations.
